# Excel-Analysis-Pivot-Tables---Summary-Insights

Sales Data Analysis & Pivot Dashboard (Excel)
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete Excel-based data analysis workflow, starting from cleaned raw data to interactive pivot dashboards and business insights. The objective is to analyze sales performance across categories, regions, and customer segments using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, slicers, and calculated metrics.

🧹 Data Preparation

Opened the dataset and cleaned obvious data quality issues:

Removed blank rows and values

Corrected incorrect date formats

Standardized inconsistent category names

Preserved raw data by maintaining a backup sheet

Converted the cleaned dataset into an Excel Table to ensure Pivot Tables automatically update when new data is added

📈 Pivot Table Analysis

Created a Pivot Table summarizing Total Sales by Category

Sorted categories from highest to lowest sales to identify business-driving segments

Built a second Pivot Table showing Sales by Region and Segment

Applied conditional formatting to highlight top-performing regions visually

🎛️ Interactivity & Advanced Metrics

Added Slicers for:

Region

Category

Segment
enabling interactive, BI-style dashboard filtering

Created a calculated column:

Profit Margin = Profit / Sales

Analyzed average Profit Margin by Category and Region using Pivot Tables

📊 Visualization

Designed Pivot Charts to:

Visualize sales distribution

Compare performance across categories

Charts dynamically update with slicer selections

🧠 Business Insights

Added 3–5 key insights below Pivot Tables to support analytical storytelling
(e.g., “West region contributes 38% of total sales”)

Insights focus on:

Top-performing regions

High-value categories

Segment-level performance

Profitability patterns
