# Excel-Analysis-Pivot-Tables---Summary-Insights

Sales Data Analysis & Pivot Dashboard (Excel)
I worked on an end-to-end sales data analysis project using Microsoft Excel, focusing on data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and business insight generation.

I began by reviewing the raw dataset and resolving data quality issues, including removing blank values, correcting date formats, and standardizing inconsistent category names. To ensure data integrity, a backup of the original dataset was maintained before applying transformations. The cleaned dataset was then converted into an Excel Table, enabling dynamic updates and ensuring all analyses automatically adjusted when new data was added.

Using Pivot Tables, I analyzed total sales by category to identify key revenue-generating segments and ranked categories from highest to lowest sales. I also created additional Pivot Tables to evaluate sales performance by region and customer segment, applying conditional formatting to highlight top-performing regions.

To enhance analytical depth, I created a calculated column for Profit Margin (Profit / Sales) and analyzed profitability trends across categories and regions. Interactive slicers were added for Region, Category, and Segment, allowing stakeholders to explore the data dynamically, similar to business intelligence dashboards.

I further developed Pivot Charts to visualize sales distribution and compare category performance. Key business insights were documented directly below the Pivot Tables to support analytical storytelling and data-driven decision-making. Finally, the complete dashboard was compiled into a structured report and exported as a PDF for easy sharing and documentation.
